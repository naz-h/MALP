# MALP
Repository with files related to the figures and numerical examples in my master's thesis. To run the files in the folder Ch5 for simulation study correctly, start with the files ending in `_func` (as they contain the function definitions), and then proceed to run `set1`, `set2`, `set3`, `set4`, and `set5` files.
