# MALP
This repository contains files related to the figures and numerical examples in my master's thesis **_On Correlation and Prediction in Regression Analysis_**. You can access the full thesis [here](https://www.diva-portal.org/smash/record.jsf?dswid=-2190&faces-redirect=true&language=en&searchType=SIMPLE&query=&af=%5B%5D&aq=%5B%5B%5D%5D&aq2=%5B%5B%5D%5D&aqe=%5B%5D&pid=diva2%3A1883543&noOfRows=50&sortOrder=author_sort_asc&sortOrder2=title_sort_asc&onlyFullText=false&sf=all).

## Running the Files

To run the files in the folder **Ch5** for the simulation study:

1. Ensure that the **set** files (**set1**, **set2**, **set3**, **set4**, **set5**) and their corresponding **_func** files (e.g., **set1_func.R**) are saved in the same working directory.
2. Start with any of the **set** files. Each of these files sources the necessary function definitions from the corresponding `_func` file, so you donâ€™t need to run those separately.
